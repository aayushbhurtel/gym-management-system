sample strategy:

  Users are consuming more content every day as more content is created, but it is very hard for 20- to 40-year-old professionals to find the content they want to watch. We want to enlighten these users, to help them discover better things to watch and understand what they’re watching more deeply. We chose to focus initially on professionals because while teens and tweens have time to spend on Facebook and YouTube, professionals have less time but also have rich networks and strong opinions — not to mention disposable capital to spend on content. Using IMDb’s unique collection of movie data and Amazon’s ability to distribute digital content and proven personalization tools, we will uniquely solve the content discovery problem by integrating these technologies and building unique suggestion algorithms. Unlike competitors such as Netflix, who already have a recommendations engine, we’ll integrate across all video sources and use our richer data to provide more interesting in-viewing experiences and more accurate recommendations. We will deliver these in-viewing experiences through platforms that can expose contextually relevant data (e.g., the cast of a YouTube video), such as a browser plug-in for YouTube and mobile applications for phones.
